**BUS288 - Business Analytics (Credits: 3)**

This course introduces the main concepts in business analytics, which allow achieving fluency in four paradigms that account for most business decisions: marketing, operations, human resources and financial analytics. Course includes learning how to explore and visualize the data and develop an analytic mindset that will help you make strategic decisions based on data. In addition, we explored the common pitfalls in interpreting statistical arguments, especially those associated with big data. Collectively, this course will helps internalize a core set of practical and effective methods and concepts, and apply them to solve some real world problems. In the final Project, we applied our skills to interpret a real-world data set and make appropriate business strategy recommendations.
